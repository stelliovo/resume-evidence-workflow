# Job Description (JD) and Resume-Skill Routing

Choose a resume skill for the actual job, candidate, and output—not by popularity or installation order.

## Build the routing profile

Extract from the job description (JD) and user context:

- country and hiring market;
- resume language;
- role family and specialization;
- industry and company type;
- candidate stage: internship, graduate, career switch, experienced hire, or leadership;
- application channel: ATS upload, recruiter, referral, portfolio-led, or public profile;
- requested artifact: text, Markdown, DOCX, editable HTML, or PDF;
- source-layout preservation needs;
- user's risk tolerance and preferred degree of assertiveness.

## Discover installed candidates

Inspect the current Agent's available skill catalog. Search descriptions for resume, CV, job, career, ATS, the target role, market, industry, language, and artifact format. Do not assume a skill is suitable from its name alone.

Read the complete `SKILL.md` of every plausible finalist and only the references required to understand its rewrite method and output. Determine whether each candidate is primarily:

- a general resume writer;
- a market-specific writer;
- an industry or role specialist;
- a job description (JD) matching tool;
- an evidence or story-mining tool;
- a renderer or document generator.

## Compare candidates

Use these dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|---|---|
| Market | Does it understand the hiring conventions of the target country or region? |
| Language | Does it write natively for the resume's language rather than merely translate? |
| Role and industry | Does it contain relevant professional vocabulary and evaluation logic? |
| Candidate stage | Is its method suitable for this level and career path? |
| job description (JD) alignment | Can it connect requirements to evidence rather than only polish prose? |
| Evidence discipline | Does it preserve ownership, scope, metrics, and uncertainty? |
| User agency | Does it expose meaningful choices and respect the user's risk preference? |
| Output | Can it preserve the source style and create the required artifact? |
| Interaction cost | Will it reuse the evidence bank or force unnecessary re-interviewing? |

Do not reduce the decision to an unexplained score. State the strongest fit, significant limitation, and intended role of each finalist.

## Select a stack

Prefer one primary content skill. Add a second skill only for a distinct downstream function such as DOCX, editable HTML, PDF inspection, or visual rendering.

Examples of valid routing logic:

- Chinese internet operations job description (JD) → a China-industry resume method as primary; document renderer as secondary.
- US product role → an English ATS/HM-oriented method as primary; portfolio or document skill only if required.
- Highly specialized finance or legal role → a domain-specific skill over a generic stylistic writer, provided its evidence rules are acceptable.

If methods conflict, do not silently combine them. Explain the conflict—such as ATS simplicity versus designed layout, conservative title fidelity versus aggressive repositioning, or chronological order versus relevance order—and ask the user when the choice materially changes the result.

## Search external skills only when needed

If no installed candidate is adequate and current network access is available, search GitHub and other authorized public sources using the target market, role, language, and desired artifact. Prefer repositories with readable skill instructions, clear license, recent maintenance, examples, and limited dependencies.

Inspect before recommending:

- `SKILL.md` scope and claims;
- repository ownership and maintenance signals;
- license and redistribution terms;
- scripts and dependencies;
- requests for credentials, uploads, or external services;
- whether examples demonstrate the claimed market and role expertise.

Recommend at most three candidates. First exclude candidates that do not fit the job description (JD)'s market, language, role, industry, candidate stage, or required output. Among the remaining adequately matched candidates, prioritize the three with the highest current GitHub star counts. Report the star count and date checked, but do not treat stars as proof of professional quality.

Include “continue directly without installing” as a real option. Make clear that using any recommendation is the user's choice; the shortlist is decision support, not a required next step. Do not add weak candidates merely to reach three.

Installation or connection requires the user's explicit choice. After installation, reload or use the skill only when the environment makes it available; do not pretend it was invoked if it was not.

## Record the route

Save:

- selected primary skill and version or path when available;
- optional rendering skill;
- reasons for selection;
- known limitations or overridden rules;
- user choices on meaningful conflicts.

This makes later resume variants reproducible without forcing permanent loyalty to one skill.
